# credit_risk_modeling

## Objectives

- Calculate the Expected Loss (EL) 
- Based on EL = PD X LGD X EAD 
- PD: Probability of Default
- LGD: Loss Given Default
- EAD: Exposure at Default 

## Dataset

- Kaggle Lending Club 

## Modeling Techniques

- Probability of Default (PD): Logistic regression
- LGD: Beta regression
- EAD: Beta regression

## Dependent Variables

- PD: Flag of whether the borrower defaulted or not (loan_status)
- LGD: How much of the loan was recovered (recoveries)
- EAD: Total exposure at moment of default compared to total exposure in the past (total recovered principal)

## Process

### 1. Data Gathering

[] TODO - Add content

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

### 3. Feature Engineering

- [ ] TODO: Convert continuous to categorical variables for use as a scorecard
